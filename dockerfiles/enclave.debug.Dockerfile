# Build stages:
# system = prepares the "OS" by downloading required binaries, installs dlv.
# get-dependencies = using the "system" downloads the go modules.
# build-enclave = copies over the source and builds the enclave using a go compiler cache
# final = using the base system copies over only the enclave executable and creates the final image without source and dependencies.

# Note: ego uses a virtual file system mount to map data directory to /data inside the enclave,
#   for this non-ego build I'm using /data as the data dir to preserve /data folder in paths inside enclave
