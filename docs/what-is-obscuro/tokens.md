# Tokens 

Obscuro's native token, OBX, provides an easy means of payment for utility within the platform including transaction fees OBX is also the means for providing a reward back to node operators for keeping the Obscuro network alive. Staking encourages node operators to observe the rules and not attempt to disrupt the safty of the Obscuro network.

Delegated staking is also available to allow others without access to large amounts of OBX to participate in the Obscuro network and share in the validator rewards.
