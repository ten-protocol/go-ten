# User Experience 

The design of Obscuro ensures that existing Ethereum apps can move over to Obscuro for virtually no cost. Any developer familiar with Ethereum can build privacy-preserving apps on Obscuro that benefit from the adoption, legitimacy, security, developer tooling and liquidity of the entire Ethereum ecosystem.

End-users can continue to use MetaMask or their favourite Ethereum wallet. Interacting with an Obscuro application is the same as interacting with any Ethereum application. With a seamless user and developer experience, Obscuro changes the paradigm around privacy on the blockchain.
