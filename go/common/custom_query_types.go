// CustomQueries are Ten-specific queries that are not supported by the Ethereum RPC API but that we wish to support
// through the same interface.
//
// We currently use the eth_getStorageAt method to route these queries through the Ethereum RPC API.
//
// In order to match the eth_getStorageAt method signature, we require that all custom queries use an incrementing "address"
// to specify the method we are calling (e.g. 0x000...001 is getUserID, 0x000...002 is listPrivateTransactions).
//
// The signature is: eth_getStorageAt(method, params, nil) where:
// - method is the address of the custom query as an address (e.g. 0x000...001)
// - params is a JSON string with the parameters for the query (this complies with the eth_getStorageAt method signature since position gets encoded as a hex string)
//
// NOTE: Private custom queries must also include "address" as a top-level field in the params json object to indicate
// the account the query is being made for.
