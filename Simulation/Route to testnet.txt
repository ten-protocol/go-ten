Testnet high level goals
--------------------------

1. Spin up Obscuro nodes or aggregators that implement the Pobi protocol.
    - Allow anyone to spin up an Obscuro node and connect it to the network
2. Connect the Obscuro nodes to L1 nodes in a test ethereum network.
3. Publish rollups to the ethereum testnet
4. Deploy smart contracts and process user transactions on Obscuro.
    a. Deploy the management contract to L1
    b. Create a wallet fork ( depending on decision on encryption)
    c. Create a block explorer for Obscuro

Non-goals:
- Performance
- Stability
- Bullet proof security
- Privacy/Encryption?
- tokens? paying for transactions?



High level tasks to achieve the non-privacy testnet starting with this Simulation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Obscuro must fully understand the Ethereum serialisation and data formats so that it can process blocks.
    - It needs to extract rollup transaction and understand if they were included in the chain
    - It needs to understand deposit transactions sent to the bridge, and if they were included.
    [
    - Given a serialized Ethereum block and the address of a management smart contract:
        - verify that the block is valid with the right difficulty, etc
        - extract deposit transactions, parse them
        - extract rollup transactions

    Can this be done by depending on geth as an external dependency?
    ]

- Obscuro must build Ethereum transactions containing rollups.
    [
    - Given a payload, and the address of the mgmt contract, construct an etheruem transction that sends that payload with enough gas.
    ]

- Choose a serialisation format for Obscuro (RLP?)
    [
    - Serialise and deserialize Obscuro rollups and transactions
    ]

- Implement reasonably robust state storage mechanism (geth) (compatible with enclaves?)
- Implement transaction execution engine on top of the storage mechanism (geth)
- Implement cryptography (hashing, signing)
    [
    - Deploy a simple ethereum smart contract
    - Execute transactions against it
    - store the root hashes in the rollups
    - support a reasonable number of accounts
    ]


- Implement node discovery mechanism based on L1 data
[
    - The management contract must register ip addresses
    - a new obscuro node must be able to read them from the block and connect to the other nodes
]

- Implement master seed generation and sharing.
- Implement key derivation

- Implement a gossip protocol for transactions and rollups


- Implement a simple RPC interface
[
- standard ethereum clients should be able to communicate with obscuro nodes for basic functions like submitting transactions and balance requests
