# TEN design documents

TEN started based on a (whitepaper)[https://whitepaper.ten.xyz/] published in Nov. 2021.

As we started development, we started thinking more deeply about some aspects and also getting feedback from the community
and the users.
This folder contains design proposals which either replace some aspects of the whitepaper or add more detail.

## Architecture

Useful resources to understand the system.


## User experience

UX was an area that we didn't cover extensively in the WP. So we focused on it early during development, and our approach is documented here.

The design documents cover aspects like:
1. The wallet extension
2. The data relevancy
3. The incentives for node operators to provide services

Note: the wallet extension and the data relevancy rules are already implemented. 


## Bridge

TEN needs a decentralised bridge infrastructure to Ethereum.

Note: this design is approved and mostly implemented (there are some dependencies on the fast-finality work). 


## Fast Soft-Finality Protocol

The POBI protocol described in the WP is completely decentralised and is something we aim for in phase 2.
However, during the first phase, we decided to start with a more centralised approach similar to the other Layer 2s.

Note: the design is approved, and currently it is being implemented.


## Security, Privacy and Cryptography

TEN is a decentralised Ethereum Layer 2 that aims to maintain privacy.
We need to design the cryptography that keeps data private.
Like any software system, it needs to be upgradeable, which is more difficult with our constraints.

Note: these designs are still a WIP.


## Scratchpad

Used for discussing various proposals.
