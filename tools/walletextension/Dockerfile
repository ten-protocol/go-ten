## Build Stages:
# system = prepares the "OS" by downloading required binaries
# get-dependencies = downloads the go modules using the prepared system
# build-wallet = copies over the source code and builds the binaries using a compiler cache
# final = copies over only the executables in an alpine image that doesn't have any additional load.
