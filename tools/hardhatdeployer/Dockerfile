# Build Stages:
# system = prepares the "OS" by downloading required binaries
# get-dependencies = downloads the go modules using the prepared system
# build-wallet = copies over the source code and builds the wallet binaries using a compiler cache
# install-npm-deps = copies over the package.json and starts downloading dependencies. 
#                    This does not depend on other stages and is executed in parallel.
# final = copies over the solidity/hardhat source, takes the installed project from the 'install-npm-deps' and the final wallet executable
#         in a lightweight image.
